# Pixel Art Maker Project Submission

Added JavaScript to allow users to create a grid of squares and apply colors to those squares.

Users are able to:
1. Dynamically set the size of the table as an N by M grid.
2. Choose a color.
3. Click a cell in the grid to fill that cell with the chosen color.

index.html and styles.css based on code provided by Udacity.
